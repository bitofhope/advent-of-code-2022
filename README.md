# Code style

lol

The programs should work on unmodified input files. They should contain functions `part1` and `part2`, each of which prints the solution to the corresponding puzzle of the day.

# How to?

```
cd dayXX
cargo run example
```

Puzzle inputs proper are personalized. Download yours from the AoC website and run `cargo run input`
